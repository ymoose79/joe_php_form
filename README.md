# joe_php_form

I spun my wheels for quite some time trying to connect mySQL to CodeIgnitor.  I'm still baffeled.  I tried both 
the .env file and also the Config Databse folder with the default variables.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's something stupid
but after spending an inordinate amount of time, I decided to connect and start working on the PHP.

I would not say I've internalized PHP in any way, shape, or form.  This list was put together from a couple different tutorials.  
There's a lot of over-lap coming from javascript, if not in syntax then in technique.
